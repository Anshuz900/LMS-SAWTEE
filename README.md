The project involves the design and implementation of an interactive Online Leave Management System for South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE). This system automates the entire process of managing and tracking various types of staff leaves. Staff members can easily submit leave requests, check the status of their applications, and view past leave transactions. The system maintains a centralized database that records each employee’s leave balance in real time and keeps a detailed log of all leave activities. It supports both full-day and half-day leave requests and includes an automated attendance tracking system for employees participating in official programs. The project was developed using the Agile system development methodology, ensuring flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

This project essentially involves three types of users:

i) Staff 

ii) Leave Approver

iii) Administrator
